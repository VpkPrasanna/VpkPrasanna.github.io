Python provides many ways to distribute your python projects. One such way is by using an important technology called Docker. Docker is an open-source application that allows administrators to create, manage, deploy, and replicate applications using containers. It is basically a platform that enables developers to make their applications portable by putting them inside a container. You can make your python project portable using it. Docker container removes dependency issues by isolating your project with system. Docker image created of your project can be ported anywhere. Official Documentation of Docker. In this article we will see an example in which we will be converting our Fast api app into docker image and see some basic commands of docker along with it. Fast is a micro-framework for building small web applications. We are just using it as an example of Python project. One can use any other python project in the same manner. For more information on Fast API, visit here.

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}

## Boxes
You can add notification, warning and error boxes like this:

### Notification

{: .box-note}
**Note:** This is a notification box.

### Warning

{: .box-warning}
**Warning:** This is a warning box.

### Error

{: .box-error}
**Error:** This is an error box. -->
